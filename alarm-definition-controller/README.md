Alarm Definition Controller Dockerfile
=====================

This image is used for running the Monasca Alarm Definition Controller in Kubernetes.
The use is for having a Monasca Alarm Definition Kubernetes Third Party Resource that
allows users to create/modify/delete alarm definitions via creating Kubernetes Resources.

This alleviates the need for users of Monasca to tie into our alarm init container or have
to tie into a centralized location of all alarm definitions. Each user controls and configures
the alarm definitions relevant to what they are working on.
