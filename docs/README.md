# monasca-docker

This repository contains resources for building and deploying a
full Monasca stack in Docker and Kubernetes environments.

## Quick Start

To quickly get a Monasca environment running, you can use
[docker-compose][1]:

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

or, if you want to deploy **log pipeline** as well:

```sh
$ docker-compose -f log-pipeline.yml -f docker-compose.yml up
```

For more details about the services that are available after
either of the aforementioned commands can be found
[here](./pipelines.md).
